##Chapter Exercises, Results, and Commentary from Functional Programming in Scala (Pilquist, Bjarnason, Chiusano


###**Welcome**###
On my first day writing Scala I found [a series of demos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLystLcmXIj3hmmw6o5CgSuf7IZs_GLckr) by developer [Caleb Josue Ru√≠z Torres](https://github.com/cruiztorresj). This repo is my record of plodding through the exercises myself, alongside his videos, and cross-referencing with the solutions in Functional Programming in Scala (my mentor calls it [The Red Book](https://github.com/fpinscala/fpinscala/tree/second-edition).  

Please help me thank Caleb Josue by subscribing to his [YouTube](https://youtube.com/@calebjosueruiztorres) channel. Let my baby steps insist: if you're going through hell, keep going!  

Muchas gracias
